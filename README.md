## Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to study the commercial viability of operating a surf and ice cream shop year-round in O'ahu, Hawaii using weather data analysis. We studied the weather data in the months of June and December to get a gauge of year-round temperatures. Using Pandas and SQLite, we queried the data to determine if this shop was sustainable year round. 
## Results
### June Temperature Summary

#### 1. Mean Temperature Comparison:     
The mean temperatures for both June and December are similar with only a 3.9 degree difference. This is not as stark of a difference as most climates when it comes     to comparing summer and winter temperatures.
#### 2. Standard Deviation Observation:
The standard deviation for temperature for both months is minimal with a 3.26 degree std deviation for June and 3.75 degree std deviation for December. This shows there is little variation in the data collected and thus the weather temperatures in O'ahu. 
#### 3. Minimum Temperature Observation:
The minimum temperature for June is 64 degrees while the minimum temperature for December is 56 degrees. Upon first glance, these temperatures seem too cold for surfing and possibly ice cream eating depending on the individual. However, these min. temperatures are most likely the night-time temperatures which wouldn't affect surfing, traditionally a day-time activity. 
## Summary
Based upon the findings of the June and December temperature summaries above, a surf and ice cream shop would thrive year-round in O'ahu based upon the data. There is minimal variation in temperature with the majority of average temperatures falling in the all-too-comfortable low to mid-70's range. Based upon the weather analysis, tourism in the area, and beautiful beaches to surf and enjoy ice cream, we would highly recommend this business opportunity. 
Another query which would provide stellar guidance on the opening of a surf and ice cream shop would be rainfall totals by month - June and Dec. This would help determine if certain seasons are not amenable for this type of shop. A second query which would be helpful would be humidity percentage by month. This would provide great insight before opening the shop due to humid days driving traffic for ice cream and surf gear (humid days drive people into the ocean to cool off).
